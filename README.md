| Final Project: Fake News Detection on Political Statements | Not Started ‚è≥ | 06/16/25  |

### Project Description

I will apply the skills learned during weeks 1 to 4 in this end-to-end project:

- Use Python fundamentals, data structures, and control flow for preprocessing logic  
- Use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization  
- Implement NLP techniques such as TF-IDF to convert text into features  
- Train and evaluate classical machine learning models using scikit-learn, including:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Random Forest  

**Dataset:** LIAR dataset  
**Dataset Details:**  
- Contains 12,800+ labeled political statements from PolitiFact  
- Labels: pants-fire, false, barely-true, half-true, mostly-true, true  
- For binary classification, labels grouped as:  
  - Fake (1): pants-fire, false, barely-true, half-true  
  - Real (0): mostly-true, true  

## Notes

- Status Legend:
  - ‚úÖ Completed
  - üöß In Progress
  - ‚è≥ Not Started

- This README will be updated weekly to track progress.
